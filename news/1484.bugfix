Fixed some bugs in the *imshowhs_grid* plotting function.
Fix 1: Before, *imshowhs_grid* inverted the plot in north-south directions, when a no-data drape was provided. This issue is solved.
Fix 2: Axis tick marks were slightly off. This issue is fixed.
Fix 3: The hillshade base layer was not plotting data from the rows and columns adjacent to the boundary nodes. This issue is solved.
Fix 4: Boundary nodes were not indicated if requested. This issue is now solved. For now, boundary nodes can be displayed in white (``color_for_closed = 'white' ``) or not at all (``color_for_closed = None ``)
